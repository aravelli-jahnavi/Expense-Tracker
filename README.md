 Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP)
The frontend is developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to provide a smooth and stylish user experience. The UI is designed to be clean, user-friendly, and responsive so users can easily track their expenses from any device.
 Key Features of the Frontend:
->Homepage
The homepage includes a welcome section with a brief description of the expense tracker.
It has a navigation bar that allows users to easily access different sections like adding expenses, viewing the dashboard, and downloading reports.
-> Expense Entry Form
This form allows users to input expense details, including:
Expense category (e.g., Food, Transport, Entertainment, etc.)
Amount spent
Date of expense
When the user submits the form, JavaScript validates the input before sending the data to the PHP backend for storage.
-> Dashboard with Chart.js
The dashboard page provides a visual representation of expenses using Chart.js.
A pie chart dynamically updates to display the distribution of expenses in different categories.
This helps users understand their spending habits and manage their budget better.
-> Filters for Expense Tracking
Users can filter expenses by date or category using JavaScript functions.
This makes it easier to track specific expenses over a period of time.

How the Expense Tracker Works
-> User logs in or registers an account.
-> They add new expenses using the entry form.
->Dashboard updates in real-time, showing a pie chart of expenses.
-> Users can filter expenses by date & category using JavaScript.
